# You emerge from a long and weary sleep;
The world appears as a large flat plane of opportunity;
The sky is boundless and blue;
You are among friends;
The air is fresh with the scent of the ocean;
You have learned acceptance and forgiveness;
But you lack knowledge and understanding;
You will be trapped forever;
The past is ever-present;
## The sun smiles at you with eternal malice;
